# Employee-Management-System-with-JDBC

Implementation:  As we know Employee management system that user use to manage employees of any organization or any company same as given task I created Employee Management System to manage employees, this system fulfilled the all prerequisites as given in the task also it store the data in Database. Apart, I implemented all the concepts of OOPs, Interface with standard design pattern to manipulate employees. 

Employee class consist appropriate attributes that shows basic but need full parameters for employee and appropriates to instantiate, instance data members.  

class name as DBUtility it is Database Utility program that responsible for communicate with the Database. Here I used technology called JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) that provides some interfaces and classes that helps to communicate and manipulate the transaction from main Application with Database.

As we having Interface that are responsible for data abstraction, so this is the EmployeeDAOImpl class act as implemented class of EmployeeDAO interface to implement unimplemented methods with some owned feature, each method comes with different behavior that very need full for our core concept that is employee management system.

The main class that provides user-friendly console to manage visible data and manipulate data by any end user. It is provides after started unstoppable menus until user donâ€™t shut the system also it provides all necessary menus to manage Employee information and bring data from database and print to the console for any HR or end-user to manage Employee Management System.
